<h1> Paragraph about the wonders of sea creatures </h1>
<p>
Dolphins sleep with only half of their brain and with one eye open so they can watch for predators and other threats. An Octopus has three hearts and the color of its blood is blue. At 188 decibels, the calls of blue whales is the loudest sound made by any animal on the planet.What Are Sea Animals? Sea animals are the animals that live deep in the seas. These include fish, like sharks, pufferfish, angelfish; molluscs like snails, clams, and oysters; crustaceans like crabs and shrimps; and mammals like whales, dolphins, sea lions, walruses, etc.
